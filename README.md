# arcpro_drought_population_tool


I developed a tool to be implemented in the arcpro GUI that gets county level drought and population data within the US based upon latitude and longitude provided in rows of an input csv; drought and poulation data are queried from US Census and Center for Disease Control API's


the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) gives a visual and lays out the architecture of the tool; the tool is found in the .tbx file and the script used for tool implementation is the .py file a sample of plots with latitude and longitude are found in the in_data folder and output is written to the out_data file
